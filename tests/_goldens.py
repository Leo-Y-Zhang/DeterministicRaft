"""Golden-digest corpus: the determinism tripwire that guards DeterministicRaft's core thesis.

DeterministicRaft's one guarantee is byte-identical replay from a seed. This module pins a
fixed matrix of ``(nodes, seed, faults, steps)`` configs to two frozen values each:

  * ``digest``    -- the sha256 of the full recorded trace (the observable behaviour)
  * ``rng_calls`` -- how many times the run drew from the single ``sim.rng`` stream

The digest catches ANY behaviour change; the rng-call count catches the specific,
insidious failure mode of *inserting a new random draw mid-stream* (the thing that
silently desynchronises every later run) even in the unlikely event the digest were
to collide. Together they turn "don't break determinism" from a review vibe into a
red test the instant a draw moves.

This file is deliberately named with a leading underscore so pytest does not collect
it as a test module; ``tests/test_goldens.py`` imports from it. Regenerate the pinned
values after an *intentional* behaviour change with::

    .venv/Scripts/python.exe tests/_goldens.py

and review the resulting ``tests/goldens.json`` diff -- only the configs you meant to
change should move.

    """A drop-in ``random.Random`` that counts public draws without changing outputs.

    Subtlety: CPython's ``Random.__init_subclass__`` inspects the subclass. If it sees
    ``random()`` overridden but not ``getrandbits()``, it switches ``_randbelow`` to the
    ``random()``-based path, which changes what ``randint``/``choice`` return. So we also
    define ``getrandbits`` (a pure pass-through, deliberately NOT counted since
    ``randint``/``choice`` route through it internally) to keep the base
    ``_randbelow_with_getrandbits`` path -- making the Mersenne-Twister stream, and
    therefore every digest, byte-identical to a plain ``random.Random``. We count only
    the three public entry points DeterministicRaft actually draws from.
