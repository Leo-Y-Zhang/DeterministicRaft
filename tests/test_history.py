"""The client-observed history recorded by a Cluster (deterministic_raft/cluster.py + kv.py).

These tests are the substrate for the linearizability oracle: they establish that the
history is deterministic, faithfully records invoke/return, and -- in the fault-free case
-- is exactly consistent with a sequential replay of the committed log (a linearizability
precursor). They also lock the guarantee that recording the history never perturbs a run.
