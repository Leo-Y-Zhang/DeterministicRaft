# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Renamed: RaftVerified -> DeterministicRaft.** The package (`raftverified/` ->
  `deterministic_raft/`), the distribution name and the console script (now
  `deterministic-raft`) move with it; `raftverified` no longer exists as either a
  command or an import. The name now states the thing worth knowing - every
  failure replays exactly from its seed - instead of claiming a verification
  stronger than simulation testing delivers.
  No behavioural change: ruff, mypy and all 469 tests pass across the rename. The
  one digest that moved is the HTML report golden, which embeds the product name
  in its title, heading, footer and replay command; substituting the old name
  back into the new page reproduces the previous pin byte for byte, so nothing
  but the name moved.

- **Renamed: Harmonia -> RaftVerified.** The Python package (`harmonia/` ->
  `raftverified/`), the distribution name, the console script and the CLI's
  printed prefixes all moved with it; the `harmonia` command no longer exists.
  Entries below are the original release notes with module paths and command
  names rewritten to the current ones - the code they describe is unchanged.
  No behavioural change: the golden trace digests and rng-draw counts in
  `tests/goldens.json` are unchanged across the rename.

## 1.2.0 - 2026-07-31

The nemesis vocabulary: declarative, hand-authored fault schedules as first-class
citizens of the existing determinism machinery (Jepsen's nemesis is the inspiration;
no affiliation).

- **`deterministic_raft/nemesis.py`**: five composable fault patterns (`partition_halves`,
  `isolate_leader` resolved at fire time, `flapping_link`, `lossy_link`,
  `crash_node`) as frozen, construction-validated dataclasses pinned to virtual-time
  instants; a `NemesisSchedule` serializes to a compact JSON form that round-trips
  exactly. Patterns draw zero randomness of their own, so a scheduled run replays
  byte-identically and layers deterministically over any fault profile (default and
  membership golden corpora stay byte-identical, asserted; nemesis configs get their
  own pinned digests).
- **Same suppression mask as the random driver**: every injection consumes a
  `_fire_fault` ordinal, so the ddmin shrinker minimises hand-authored schedules
  with no parallel mechanism, and `Scenario` carries the schedule through
  shrink/replay. State-dependent injections with nothing to do (no believed leader,
  node already down) skip without consuming an ordinal.
- **CLI `--nemesis JSON` on all four commands**; a violation's printed replay hint
  quotes the schedule back verbatim and parses back through the real parser to the
  identical schedule (asserted end-to-end). Validation is total and exits 2 on any
  bad schedule: unknown patterns, missing/extra fields, non-integer fields (a
  fractional node id previously escaped as a mid-run KeyError), out-of-range
  probabilities, and flap cycles above `MAX_FLAP_CYCLES` (10000; each cycle
  materialises one injection up-front, so a runaway value was a memory DoS).
- **The bug registry, re-caught under direction** (`tests/test_nemesis.py`): a
  hand-authored campaign of minority-starving halves splits, leader isolations and
  a crash over `light` noise (which injects no partitions or crashes of its own)
  catches `vote_for_stale_candidate` -> LeaderCompleteness, `skip_log_consistency`
  -> LogMatching/StateMachineSafety, `allow_commit_regression` ->
  CommitIndexMonotonic, `stale_local_reads` -> the linearizability oracle only, with
  the unbugged twin clean and linearizable over the same campaign. The May-2015
  membership bug reproduces under directed 3|3 halves splits at six servers at
  pinned seed 171 (`drop_config_commit_guard`); the guarded twin survives the
  identical campaign at seeds 170-172. `drop_commit_term_guard` (Figure 8) is
  deliberately not searched for under nemesis - no driven search in this repo
  reliably reproduces the full prior-term overwrite - and stays the deterministic
  mechanism test in `tests/test_bugs.py`.
- **Report footer fixed**: the HTML report's replay command now carries
  `--membership` and `--nemesis` (it previously omitted `--membership` since 1.1.0,
  and would have omitted `--nemesis`), so pasting it reproduces the documented run,
  not a fault-free lookalike; the default report golden is byte-identical (pinned).
- mypy `--strict` made clean again (an uninferable lambda in `cluster.py` was
  replaced by a typed helper, proven digest-neutral by the pinned golden corpus).
- 407 -> 469 tests plus the marked slow sweep; ruff and mypy `--strict` clean.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-07-30

Single-server cluster membership changes (Ongaro dissertation ch. 4), plus the real
May-2015 membership bug as the sixth injectable.

- **Single-server membership changes**: a configuration entry takes effect the moment
  it is appended (pre-commit); elections, commits and ReadIndex confirmations count
  majorities over the current configuration. Two leader guards make that safe: one
  change in flight at a time, and no change before a current-term commit (the
  May-2015 raft-dev amendment). Membership is derived state - rebuilt from the
  log/snapshot across crash-restart, truncation, compaction and `InstallSnapshot`
  (whose wire format now carries the configuration at the snapshot index; the
  snapshot golden matrix was rebaselined once for it).
- **Membership mode** behind `Cluster(membership=True)` / CLI `--membership` (all
  four commands): starts one server outside the configuration and runs a
  deterministic, zero-randomness churn driver that proposes single-server changes to
  every node that believes it is leader. Own golden-digest matrix; default goldens
  byte-identical (asserted).
- **Checker generalized in lockstep** (same commit as the feature): per-configuration
  majorities plus a new machine-checked property, CommitQuorum - a newly committed
  entry must be held by a majority of the committing node's current configuration.
  Planted-bug FakeNode tests prove catch and no-false-positive.
- **The historical injectable** (`drop_config_commit_guard`): resurrects the
  dissertation-published algorithm (no current-term-commit guard). A hand-driven test
  replays Ongaro's raft-dev example exactly (disjoint majorities, committed entries
  overwritten, Leader Completeness fires); a pinned natural repro (6 servers, chaos
  seed 354) trips it in ordinary churn and ddmin shrinks it to a 1-minimal
  counterexample; a 5-server control sweep shows the bug needs the sixth server.
- Test-count corrections: 1.0.0 shipped 343 tests (not the 342 stated below);
  now 343 -> 407 tests plus the marked slow sweep.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-07-09

From an internal-invariant Raft simulator to a Jepsen-grade, self-minimizing DST
consensus testbed. Everything below is verified by the invariant checker (run after
every simulator step) and stays perfectly reproducible from a seed.

- **Replicated key-value state machine** (`put` / `get` / `cas`) with structured
  commands, per-client **exactly-once sessions** (Ongaro 6.3), and a recorded
  client-operation history.
- **Linearizability oracle** (`deterministic_raft/linearizability.py`): Wing-Gong
  linearize-and-remove over the client history, catching stale reads,
  acknowledged-but-lost writes and double-applied retries that the internal
  invariants cannot express.
- **Injectable-bug harness** (`deterministic_raft/bugs.py`): five deliberately-planted
  consensus bugs, all off by default, each caught by exactly the property it targets
  (four internal invariants, one only by the oracle) - proof the checker works.
- **Automatic schedule shrinker** (`deterministic_raft/shrink.py`): ddmin over the fault
  injections plus a step-budget binary search, delta-debugging any failure to a
  minimal, replayable counterexample; deterministic fault-suppression mask.
- **Real crash-restart**: a crash discards all volatile state (only currentTerm,
  votedFor and the log persist); restart rebuilds the state machine from the log.
  The checker became crash-aware via per-node incarnations.
- **Log compaction + `InstallSnapshot`** (section 7): committed prefixes fold into a
  snapshot; lagging followers are re-seeded; the invariant checker was generalized in
  lockstep to reason over (compacted prefix + live tail).
- **ReadIndex linearizable reads** (section 8): a get served from local state only
  after a confirmed heartbeat round and a current-term commit - no log entry.
- **`deterministic_raft report`**: a self-contained HTML report (summary + timeline + verdict).
- Tooling: golden-digest determinism tripwire + rng-draw guard, ruff, mypy `--strict`,
  CI. 151 -> 342 tests, stdlib-only runtime.

## 0.1.0 - 2026-07-07

Initial release.

- Discrete-event simulator: virtual clock, priority event queue, seeded
  RNG; simulated network with message drop, duplication, delay, reordering
  and partitions, driven by fault profiles (none / light / chaos).
- Raft node state machine per the 2014 paper: randomized election
  timeouts, RequestVote / AppendEntries, log replication, majority commit
  with the current-term guard (figure 8), nextIndex backoff log repair.
- Invariant checker run after every simulator step, enforcing the paper's
  five safety properties: Election Safety, Leader Append-Only, Log
  Matching, Leader Completeness, State Machine Safety.
- Bounded liveness check under none/light fault profiles.
- Hand-rolled SVG timeline renderer (terms, elections, commits,
  partitions per node over virtual time).
- CLI: deterministic_raft run / check / replay - every run reproducible from its
  seed; run --timeline emits a dependency-free SVG timeline.
- 151 pytest tests plus a marked long sweep; mypy clean; stdlib-only
  runtime.
