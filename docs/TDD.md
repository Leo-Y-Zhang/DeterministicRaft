# DeterministicRaft — technical design

v1.2.0, written from the code rather than from the README. Every claim names the module
it lives in; where the code and the marketing disagreed, the code won. Requirements:
[PRD.md](PRD.md).

## One process, one seed, one clock

`Simulator` (`sim.py`) is a priority queue of callbacks keyed by `(virtual_time,
sequence)`; one *step* pops and runs exactly one callback. Everything that could be
nondeterministic — message delay, drop, duplication, election timeouts, which node a
client tries, fault-driver decisions — draws from a single seeded `random.Random` in a
fixed textual order, so `(nodes, seed, faults, steps)` fully determines the run.

`Network` sits between nodes and applies the faults. `RaftNode` (`node.py`) is the
algorithm alone, with no clock, no I/O and no RNG of its own, which is the property that
makes it simulable at all. `Cluster` (`cluster.py`) wires N nodes to one network, runs the
client, fault, membership and nemesis drivers, and — the part that matters — calls
`InvariantChecker.check()` after *every* single step rather than at the end.

Three verification layers sit on top. All are pure functions drawing zero randomness, so
enabling one cannot perturb a run:

1. `invariants.py` — the paper's five safety properties plus commit-index monotonicity and
   a per-configuration commit quorum, over node *logs*.
2. `linearizability.py` — a Wing–Gong linearize-and-remove oracle over the *client*
   history, which sees things the log invariants structurally cannot; a stale read is
   perfectly legal in every log.
3. `shrink.py` — ddmin over the fault injections plus a binary search on the step budget,
   turning a failing 20,000-step seed into a minimal, replayable counterexample.

## The determinism contract

Five invariants of the codebase, enforced by tests rather than by convention. Everything
else in this document assumes them.

**1. Append, never insert.** A new RNG draw goes at the end of an existing draw sequence.
Inserting one shifts every subsequent value and rewrites history. `tests/goldens.json`
pins both the trace digest *and* the RNG draw count for about twelve configurations;
`tests/test_goldens.py` instruments `random.Random` to count.

**2. Sort before any draw, message or trace line.** Any iteration over node ids,
`next_index`, configurations or session dicts that feeds an RNG draw, a message or the
trace is `sorted()` first.

**3. Oracles are pure.** The invariant checker, the linearizability oracle, the shrinker's
candidate replays and the HTML report draw zero randomness. `record_history` gates only
whether the list is kept, never any behaviour.

**4. Suppression is ordinal, not positional.** Each fault injection takes the next integer
from `Cluster._fault_seq` *after* all of its RNG draws have happened (`_fire_fault`). The
shrinker suppresses ordinals; the draws still occur, so an empty mask is byte-identical to
an unshrunk run, and a masked run does not desync the stream.

**5. New RPC rounds are opt-in.** ReadIndex and snapshots have their own message types and
their own config flags, precisely so a default run is byte-identical to one from before
they existed.

## State, and what survives a crash

No database, no files, no schema. The persisted structures are all in-memory dataclasses;
"stable storage" is the subset of `RaftNode` fields a simulated crash does not clear.

| Structure | Where | Fields that matter |
|---|---|---|
| `Entry` | `node.py` | `term: int`, `command: str` — frozen; `command` is opaque to Raft |
| `Command` | `kv.py` | `client_id`, `req_id`, `op ∈ {put,get,cas}`, `key`, `value`, `expected`; encodes to a 6-field `:`-separated string. **`decode` is total** — anything malformed becomes a NOOP, so the state machine can never raise on a log entry |
| configuration entry | `node.py` | an ordinary log entry whose command is `cfg:0,1,2`; `Command.decode` sees a NOOP, the Raft layer decodes the voting set |
| `Snapshot` | `kv.py` | `last_index`, `last_term`, `store`, `sessions`, `voters` — the configuration is inside the snapshot, because membership must survive compaction |
| `HistoryEntry` | `kv.py` | one client operation: invoke step, return step, observed result. `return_step is None` ⇒ never completed |
| `RunResult` | `cluster.py` | `trace: list[str]` (the digest input), `events` (the timeline input), `stats`, `final` |
| `NemesisSchedule` | `nemesis.py` | frozen tuple of frozen patterns; `to_json` / `from_json` round-trip exactly, and that JSON string *is* the replay token |

The persistent/volatile split (`node.py`: `pause`, `_reset_volatile`, `resume`) is the
whole point of crash-restart, so it is written out rather than implied.

*Survives a crash:* `term`, `voted_for`, `log`, `base_index`, `base_term`, `snapshot`.

*Lost on a crash:* `role`, `commit_index`, `last_applied`, `applied`, the KV state
machine, `leader_id`, `next_index`, `match_index`, `_votes`, `_client_index`,
`_pending_reads`, `_committed_this_term`.

*Derived on restart:* the state machine is rebuilt from the snapshot and re-applied log,
and the *configuration* is re-derived from the latest config entry in the log — falling
back to the snapshot's, then to the initial set — so membership needs no separate
persistence.

Two counters exist purely to make verification cheap and correct. `log_version` is bumped
on any log mutation, and the checker caches expensive pairwise comparisons on it.
`incarnation` increments on every restart, and the checker keys its per-node caches on it,
so a legitimately reset commit index is not mistaken for a monotonicity violation.

```

`NodeView` (`invariants.py`) is a `Protocol`, not a base class. The checker depends only
on a narrow read-only surface — `role`, `term`, `log`, `commit_index`, `applied`,
`log_version`, `incarnation`, `base_index`, `base_term`, `voters`, and three log accessors
— which is what lets `tests/test_invariants.py` plant divergence with fake nodes and prove
the checker *catches* it. A checker that has never been seen to fail proves nothing.

## The security surface, such as it is

No server, no database, no authentication, no multi-tenancy, no stored data. Nothing
grants anything to anyone. Three things are still worth naming.

**`--nemesis JSON` is the only untrusted input.** Parsed with `json.loads` into frozen
dataclasses that validate in `__post_init__`. Unknown pattern names, non-integer fields —
with `bool` explicitly excluded, since `True` is an `int` in Python — out-of-range
probabilities and runaway `cycles` are all rejected before the first simulator step. A
schedule naming a node the cluster does not have is rejected by `Cluster.__init__`.
Nothing is `eval`'d or imported by name.

**File writes** happen only to paths the caller passes: `--timeline`, `--out`.

**The injectable-bug registry is not reachable from the CLI.** `bugs.py` is a library
parameter used by tests. There is deliberately no `--bug` flag, so no invocation of the
shipped binary can arm a defect.

## The irreversible act is rebaselining goldens, not shipping code

There is no persistent store to migrate and no deployment to roll back. Reverting a code
change is `git revert` plus `pip install -e .` — seconds — and the previous version is
byte-identical, because there is no state to migrate.

The substantive question is *how we would know* a change was wrong, and the answer is the
golden corpus. A revert that restores the pinned digests and RNG draw counts restores the
exact previous behaviour, provably. Which means changing `tests/goldens.json` silently is
exactly as dangerous as editing an applied migration: it destroys the evidence that a
change was determinism-neutral.

So the repo's rule is that a rebaseline lands in one reviewable commit showing *only* the
intended configurations moving, with the reason stated. The `Harmonia → DeterministicRaft`
rename is the worked example. The HTML report golden moved because the page embeds the
product name, and the commit proves it by showing that substituting the old name back into
the new page reproduces the old digest exactly. Reversing the rename reverses the digest
the same way — demonstrated by substitution before the re-pin, not assumed.

## What the tests would catch

471 tests across 24 files, plus one long sweep behind the `slow` marker.

**Positive — the legitimate thing still works.** 100-seed chaos sweeps stay clean; bounded
liveness holds under `none` and `light`; legal compaction and legal reconfiguration do
**not** false-positive the checker.

**Negative — the thing being prevented is prevented.** Each of the six injectable bugs
trips exactly the property it targets (`tests/test_bugs.py`), and again under *directed*
nemesis campaigns (`tests/test_nemesis.py`). The May-2015 membership bug is reproduced both
as a hand-driven mechanism and as an in-the-wild 1000-seed hunt, with the guarded twin
surviving the identical campaign (`tests/test_membership.py`).

**Boundary.** Log indexing across a compaction boundary at `base_index == 0` and above
(`tests/test_log_offset.py`, `tests/test_snapshots.py`); commit-index reset across a crash
incarnation (`tests/test_persistence.py`); empty and single-op histories in the oracle
(`tests/test_linearizability.py`); malformed nemesis JSON in every rejected shape
(`tests/test_nemesis.py`); and a report whose replay command must carry `--membership` and
`--nemesis`, or it would document one run and replay another (`tests/test_report.py`).

**Determinism.** Run-twice-compare per feature, the pinned golden matrix, and a real
subprocess invocation of `python -m deterministic_raft` (`tests/test_cli.py`) — which is also the
only test that would catch cross-process nondeterminism such as hash-order leakage. That
residual risk is currently low, because every set and dict feeding a draw, a message or
the trace is keyed by `int` or sorted first, but it is not separately proven.

## What breaks, and the one defect left in on purpose

| What breaks | Who notices | How we detect it | How we undo it |
|---|---|---|---|
| An RNG draw is inserted mid-stream by a new feature | Anyone replaying an old seed; every pinned trace | `tests/test_goldens.py` — digest **and** draw-count mismatch | Move the draw to the end of its sequence; rebaseline only if the change was intended, in its own commit |
| The invariant checker is not generalised in lockstep with a feature (snapshots' compacted prefix, membership's per-node majorities) | Nobody — this is the dangerous one: it presents as a **false green** | Planted-bug tests with fake nodes (`tests/test_invariants.py`, `tests/test_membership.py`) that must still catch a cross-boundary / cross-configuration divergence | Revert the feature; the checker change ships in the same commit as the feature by rule |
| A client-visible defect that no log invariant can express (stale read, lost acknowledged write, double-applied retry) | The client, in a real system | The linearizability oracle; `bugs.stale_local_reads` is the standing positive control that must be missed by all five invariants and caught only by the oracle | Fix the read path; the oracle test is the regression |
| The oracle's search budget (500,000 states) is exhausted | The user, as a bogus "NOT LINEARIZABLE" | Nothing — **known defect**, see below | Raise `budget`, or bound with `max_ops` |
| A hand-authored nemesis schedule is malformed | The user | Total validation before step 0; exit code 2 with the specific field named | Fix the JSON |
| A counterexample from an *armed* bug prints a replay command that does not reproduce it | Whoever pastes the command | Nothing — the hint carries `--membership` and `--nemesis` but not the bug flags, which have no CLI representation | Only affects deliberately-injected bugs (test-only); a genuine defect's hint is exact |
| A shrink run reports a different failure from the original | The user | `shrink()` refuses to proceed unless the scenario's signature matches the target, and returns `None` otherwise | Nothing to undo; the shrinker never mutates the live run |

The known defect in that table, recorded deliberately rather than fixed here:
`linearizability.check` returns `linearizable=False` for two different situations — a
genuine counterexample, and an exhausted search budget whose result is *undetermined*.
`shrink.failure_signature` maps both to the signature `"nonlinearizable"`, so an
undetermined search would be delta-debugged as if it were a real violation. No
configuration in the current corpus approaches the budget, so this has never fired. The
fix is a three-valued verdict, not a bigger budget.

## The order things landed, and the two rules that fixed it

Determinism tripwire and tooling gate → KV state machine and client history →
exactly-once sessions → linearizability oracle → injectable-bug registry → ddmin shrinker
→ real crash-restart → log base-offset abstraction → snapshots and `InstallSnapshot`, with
the checker generalised in the same commit → ReadIndex and single-server membership → HTML
report and the nemesis vocabulary.

Two ordering rules held throughout: nothing that changes indexing lands before the
abstraction that hides indexing, and no feature lands before the checker that can judge it.
