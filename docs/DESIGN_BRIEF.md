# Design Brief — the run timeline and the HTML report

Two visual surfaces, both generated, both dependency-free, both pure functions of a run:
the SVG timeline (`deterministic_raft/timeline.py`, about 200 lines of hand-written SVG) and the
standalone HTML report (`deterministic_raft/report.py`, inline CSS, inline SVG, no external asset
of any kind). Nothing else has a visual surface; the CLI is deliberately plain text.

Numbers below are measured, not intended. See [PRD.md](PRD.md) and
[APP_FLOW.md](APP_FLOW.md).

## Encoding: thickness first, shape second, colour last

Colour is never the only signal in the SVG, and the ordering is deliberate.

Role is encoded by bar **thickness** — follower 8px, candidate 14px, leader 20px, with the
leader additionally outlined `#333` — so the most important distinction survives greyscale
printing entirely. Events are encoded by **shape**: triangle for an election, dot for a
vote, tick for a commit, diamond for a snapshot. A leader's term is additionally written as
a text label (`L177`) at the moment it takes office.

The one genuinely colour-only encoding is *which* term a bar belongs to, and the palette
cycles every eight terms. Both facts are stated in the rendered legend rather than left for
a reader to discover.

## An instrument, not a dashboard

Someone should be able to look at 20,000 steps of chaos and see, in one glance, when each
node led, when it was down, when the cluster was split, and where commits happened — then
point at a pixel and say "that election, there".

It must never feel like a status page. No gauges, no traffic lights, no smoothing, no
"health score". If a run was ugly, the picture is ugly, because the ugly part is the
evidence. The only judgement the report renders is the linearizability verdict, and that is
a factual PASS/FAIL badge with the oracle's own message beside it.

## Two readers, both with about a minute

The author, mid-debug, who already has a failing seed and needs to see *where* in virtual
time the interesting thing happened before opening the trace.

A reviewer with no context, opening `docs/showcase-report.html` from a link. This person
will not read the axis legend first, so the picture has to be legible before it is
understood — and the legend has to be there when they look for it.

Neither is on a phone. Both are at a desk with a browser or an SVG viewer.

## Borrowed from

Jepsen's Knossos analysis plots, for putting *time on the x-axis and a process in a lane*,
so concurrency is spatial rather than described.

Chrome DevTools' performance flame timeline, for using a background band to carry a global
condition — here, an active partition — instead of annotating every lane, so "everything
was broken during this window" reads without repetition.

`git log --graph`, for legibility in a monospace grid with no chrome and no colour required
to understand the structure.

## Refusals

- **Animation of any kind.** The run is already over; motion would imply a live system and
  would break byte-identical output.
- **Interactive tooltips or JavaScript.** The report must open from a `file://` URL in ten
  years. It contains zero script tags.
- **Any external request** — a font CDN, an icon set, a chart library.
  `test_report_is_self_contained_html` asserts that no `http://` appears other than the SVG
  XML namespace.
- **Rounding away the ugly parts.** No axis smoothing, no clamped outliers, no "≈".
- **A colour scale that implies magnitude.** Term numbers are nominal, not ordinal; a
  sequential ramp would suggest term 9 is "more" than term 2.

## Palette

| Role | Value | Where |
|---|---|---|
| surface | `#fafafa` page, `#fff` cards/table/timeline panel | report |
| text | `#1a1a1a` | report body |
| muted | `#555` (h2), `#777` (subtitle), `#888` (card labels), `#aaa` (footer) | report |
| success | `#1e7e34` on `#e6f4ea` | LINEARIZABLE pill |
| danger | `#c62828` on `#fdecea` | NOT LINEARIZABLE pill |
| term identity | 8-colour categorical palette (Tableau-10 derived), cycling | SVG bars |
| crashed | `#c8c8c8` | SVG bars |
| election / partition | `#e15759` | SVG triangle, band |
| commit | `#59a14c` | SVG tick |
| snapshot | `#b07aa1` | SVG diamond |

## Type, geometry, and the absence of states

One family each, no exceptions. The SVG is entirely `font-family="monospace"`: it is a
technical diagram, and column alignment matters more than personality. The HTML report uses
the system UI stack (`-apple-system, Segoe UI, Roboto, sans-serif`) at 14px/1.5 for prose,
with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` on every table cell so digits line up down the
column, and a monospace `<code>` for hashes and commands. Sizes in use: 20px h1, 14px
uppercase-tracked h2, 14px body, 13px code, 12px card labels; in the SVG, 14px title, 11px
node labels, 10px legend, 9px axis.

The SVG is a fixed 1100 × (56 + 48·nodes + 96) px, one 48px lane per node, with a gridline
every `duration/10` ms and a labelled tick. The HTML uses 24px page padding, a 10px flex
gap, cards at `12px 16px` with an 8px radius and a 1px `#e5e5e5` border, and 24px between
sections. The timeline sits in an `overflow: auto` panel, so a wide SVG scrolls inside its
container instead of stretching the page.

There are no interactive states — no links, no buttons, no inputs, no hover, no focus,
nothing to disable. That follows directly from "one static artefact", and it is why the
keyboard and touch-target clauses below have nothing to bite on. The content states that do
exist are verdict PASS, verdict FAIL, and a nodes table that is never empty, since a run
always has at least one node.

## Contrast, measured — and five failures

Computed with the WCAG relative-luminance formula against the actual background each
element sits on.

| Pair | Ratio | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| `#1a1a1a` body on `#fafafa` | 16.67:1 | pass |
| `#555` h2 on `#fafafa` | 7.14:1 | pass |
| `#111` on white (SVG title, node labels) | 18.88:1 | pass |
| `#333` on white (SVG legend, 10px) | 12.63:1 | pass |
| `#c62828` on `#fdecea` (FAIL pill) | 4.92:1 | pass |
| `#1e7e34` on `#e6f4ea` (PASS pill) | 4.52:1 | pass, barely |
| `#777` on `#ffffff` (SVG axis, 9px) | 4.48:1 | **fail** (4.5 needed) |
| `#777` on `#fafafa` (report subtitle, 14px) | 4.29:1 | **fail** |
| `#888` on `#ffffff` (card labels, 12px) | 3.54:1 | **fail** |
| `#e15759` on white (partition label, 9px) | 3.68:1 | **fail** |
| `#aaa` on `#fafafa` (footer, 12px) | 2.23:1 | **fail** badly |

Five failures, all in secondary text, none of them in a number a reader needs. They are
recorded rather than fixed in this pass for a specific reason: the HTML report is pinned by
a byte-exact golden digest, so a CSS change is a deliberate rebaseline and belongs in its
own commit with its own justification — not smuggled in alongside a rename. The remedies
are known and cheap: `#888 → #6b6b6b`, `#aaa → #767676`, `#777 → #6e6e6e`, and the 9px SVG
labels either darkened or enlarged.

## The rest of the floor, honestly

**200% zoom and 320px width.** The report's card grid wraps via flexbox and the timeline
panel scrolls, so it degrades acceptably — but there is **no `<meta name="viewport">`** in
the report's head, so a phone renders it zoomed out. A real gap, one line to fix.

**`prefers-reduced-motion`.** Trivially satisfied: no motion, no transition, no animation
anywhere.

**Colour-blindness.** The categorical palette is Tableau-derived and reasonably separable,
and every semantic distinction — role, event type, crashed versus live — is carried by
shape or thickness as well. Term-to-term distinction is the one that would degrade.

**Screen readers.** The SVG has no `<title>`/`<desc>` element and no ARIA roles, so it is
announced as an unlabelled graphic. The README supplies alt text where the image is
embedded, which covers the common path but not the report page itself.

**Input escaping.** The report escapes untrusted-shaped values — `html.escape` on the
verdict message, the fault profile and the replay command — but `render_timeline` inserts
its `title` argument into the SVG unescaped. Every caller today builds that string from
validated ints and a fixed choice list, so nothing malformed can reach it; a library caller
passing arbitrary text would produce broken SVG. Worth a `saxutils.escape` when the file is
next touched.

## Done means

- [x] Reads as an instrument, not a dashboard
- [x] Every content state rendered (PASS, FAIL, crashed nodes, partition windows, snapshots)
- [x] Zero external assets — asserted by a test, not by inspection
- [x] Byte-identical output for a fixed run — asserted by a golden test
- [x] Colour never the only signal for role or event type
- [ ] Contrast: five secondary-text pairs fail, listed above with their fixes
- [ ] Viewport meta tag on the report
- [ ] SVG `<title>`/`<desc>` for screen readers
