"""Safety invariant checker, run after every simulator step.

Asserts the five Raft safety properties from Figure 3 of the paper, plus commit
index monotonicity and a per-configuration commit quorum (a newly committed entry
must be held by a majority of the committing node's CURRENT configuration --
membership changes make cluster majorities per-node state, never a fixed size).
A violation raises InvariantViolation carrying the seed and step so the run can
be replayed exactly.

The checker only reads node state (role, term, log, commit_index, applied,
log_version), never mutates it. Caches keyed on log_version keep the per-step
cost near-constant: expensive pairwise log comparisons only rerun when one of
the logs actually changed.
