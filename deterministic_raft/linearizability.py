"""A linearizability oracle over the client-observed history (co-crown A).

The five internal Raft invariants check node logs; they cannot see whether what CLIENTS
observed is a legal single-copy history. This oracle can: given the recorded operations
(each an invoke/return interval against the KV register/map with an observed result), it
searches for a total order -- a *linearization* -- that (a) respects real-time order (if
op A returned before op B was invoked, A precedes B) and (b) makes every op's observed
result match applying it in that order to a sequential reference KV. If such an order
exists the history is linearizable; otherwise it is not, and we report the frontier where
the search got stuck.

Algorithm: Wing & Gong's "linearize and remove" (as popularised by Jepsen/Knossos). At
each step the next op must be one that is *minimal* in the real-time partial order among
the ops not yet placed (no un-placed op returned before it was invoked). Try each minimal
op whose result is legal in the current state, recurse, and memoise dead-end
(state, remaining) pairs. Concurrency width here is bounded by the number of clients, so
the search stays small.

Pending (never-returned) operations are EXCLUDED, and this is sound in DeterministicRaft: a history
row is completed the instant the op is first applied, so an op that never returned never
committed and therefore never touched the state machine. Excluding it cannot hide a real
effect (no completed read could have observed it), so it produces no false positives.

Pure function of an already-deterministic history: draws no randomness, mutates no run.
