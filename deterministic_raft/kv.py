"""The replicated state machine: a linearizable key-value store, plus the structured
client commands and the client-observed history that the linearizability oracle checks.

Raft replicates an opaque command log; the *meaning* of those commands is the state
machine's business. DeterministicRaft's state machine is a small string->string key-value store
supporting three operations:

  * ``put(key, value)``            -> always "ok"
  * ``get(key)``                   -> the current value ("" if absent)
  * ``cas(key, expected, value)``  -> "ok" if the current value == expected (then set),
                                      else "fail" (compare-and-set)

Commands travel through the log as a canonical ``str`` (``Entry.command``), so the Raft
core, the trace, the digest and the invariant checker are all unchanged. ``Command``
encodes/decodes that string. Decoding is *total*: any string that is not a well-formed
command (e.g. the opaque strings the unit tests use, or a future command type) decodes
to a NOOP that leaves the store untouched -- the state machine never raises on the log.

Everything here is a pure function of the (already deterministic) committed log: applying
the same command sequence always yields the same store and the same results, on every
node and every replay. No randomness is drawn here.
