"""Nemesis vocabulary: declarative, replayable fault schedules (hand-authored chaos).

The random fault driver EXPLORES the fault space; a nemesis DIRECTS it. A
``NemesisSchedule`` is a plain-data list of named fault patterns -- split the cluster
into halves, isolate whoever currently believes it leads, flap or degrade one link,
crash one node -- each pinned to a virtual-time instant. The vocabulary is deliberately
Jepsen-shaped (their nemesis process is the inspiration; no affiliation) but keeps
DeterministicRaft's one non-negotiable: everything is deterministic from the seed.

Three properties make schedules first-class citizens of the existing machinery rather
than a parallel mechanism:

* **Pure data.** Patterns are frozen dataclasses that validate on construction, draw
  ZERO randomness of their own, and serialize to/from a compact JSON form
  (``to_json``/``from_json``) that round-trips exactly -- so a failing schedule can be
  pasted into a replay command (CLI ``--nemesis``) and reproduced byte-for-byte.
* **Same suppression mask.** Every injection a schedule fires consumes one ordinal from
  the SAME ``_fire_fault`` counter the random driver uses (see cluster.py), so the ddmin
  shrinker minimises hand-authored schedules with no new code paths.
* **Composable.** Patterns overlay: several may be active at once, a schedule may run on
  top of any fault profile (``none`` for pure hand-authored runs, ``chaos`` to layer
  structure over noise), and same-instant injections fire in declaration order.

Times are virtual milliseconds, matching the simulator clock.
