"""The Raft node state machine, in one readable module.

Follows Ongaro & Ousterhout, "In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm"
(USENIX ATC 2014), Figure 2. Implemented here: leader election with randomized
timeouts, RequestVote and AppendEntries RPCs, log replication, commitIndex
advancement (majority match with the current-term guard from section 5.4.2), and
follower log repair via nextIndex backoff.

Also here: crash-restart with true volatile-state loss, snapshots/InstallSnapshot
(section 7), ReadIndex reads (section 8), and single-server membership changes
(dissertation ch. 4): a configuration entry in the log names the current voting set
and takes effect IMMEDIATELY on append (pre-commit); elections, commits and ReadIndex
confirmations count majorities over that set. See README limitations for the edges.

Log indices are 1-based, exactly as in the paper. With no snapshot the entry at logical
index i lives at self.log[i-1]; once a prefix is compacted (base_index > 0) all indexing
goes through the log helpers, which hide the physical offset.
